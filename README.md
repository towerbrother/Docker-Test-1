# Project 1: Personal TypeScript Web App

## Focus areas

Container basics, Image basics

## TODO

Create a simple TypeScript web application (Express or Next.js) containerized with Docker:

- Write a Dockerfile for your TypeScript application
- Build and run your container locally
- Pass environment variables to your container
- Map container ports to host ports
- Push your image to Docker Hub

## Goal

Understand how containers work, how to create custom images, and basic interactions between your host and containers.
